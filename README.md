 Recently OpenAI has published their [OpenAI o1](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/) model. Which have the ability to do reasoning. It was rated 1800 on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/). Although the rating is not high at all, it show the potencial of reshaping the software engineering. I can already imagine a future where SDEs no longer need to write code for simple tasks like basic CRUD and APIs.

 I agree that this model has the potential to reshape the field of software engineering. Even though the rating might not seem too high now, these models are only going to get better. I completely agree that SDEs will no longer need to write code for simple tasks, and we are already seeing that happening now.
