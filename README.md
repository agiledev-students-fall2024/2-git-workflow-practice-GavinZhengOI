 Recently OpenAI has published their [OpenAI o1](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/) model. Which have the ability to do reasoning. It was rated 1800 on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/). Although the rating is not high at all, it show the potencial of reshaping the software engineering. I can already imagine a future where SDEs no longer need to write code for simple tasks like basic CRUD and APIs.
